/* 
	Iup wrapper for Go.
	
	Documentation of this package is minimal on purpose. The Iup 
	documentation is very good and iup.go strives to maintain a
	one-to-one relation with the C version of Iup. Where iup.go
	differs from the C variant documentation will exist.
	
	iup.go function names drop the Iup prefix as they are under
	the iup package. iup.go constant names drop the IUP_ prefix
	as they are under the iup package.
